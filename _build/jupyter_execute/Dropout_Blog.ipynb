    "### 🎯 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models are powerful, but they often suffer from overfitting—performing well on training data but poorly on new data.\n",
    "A widely used solution is Dropout, a simple yet effective technique where random neurons are turned off during training to force the network to generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog explores how different dropout rates affect training behavior, using actual experiment results from a CNN trained on MNIST."

    "### 🔍 What Is Dropout?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout was introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) as a regularization technique for neural networks. Dropout randomly disables a fraction p of neurons during training.\n",
    "This prevents the model from depending too heavily on small sets of neurons. During training, every neuron has a probability  𝑝 of being “dropped” (set to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates many different “thinned networks” during training and prevents co-adaptation of features."

    "### Why it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Prevents co-adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons cannot rely on specific other neurons. They learn redundant, generalizable features.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Acts like training multiple models\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dropout configuration is like a new sub-model. The final model behaves like an ensemble, improving generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Reduces overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "When dropout is used correctly, test accuracy increases while training accuracy decreases slightly (which is good)."
